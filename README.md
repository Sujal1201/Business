# Phone Service Menu Program

This is a simple C program that simulates a phone service menu. It allows users to perform various actions such as checking balance, changing language, viewing account info, and accessing different services offered by a telecom provider.

## How to Use

1. **Compilation**: Compile the program using a C compiler such as GCC.
```
gcc main.c -o phone_service_menu
```

2. **Execution**: Run the compiled executable.
```
./phone_service_menu
```

3. **Menu Navigation**: Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through the menu options and choose the desired action.

4. **Exiting**: To exit the program, select option `0` from the menu.

## Features

- Allows users to change language preference.
- Provides information on balance, offers, account details, recharge options, and other services.
- Simulates a simple interactive menu system.

## Notes

- This program is a basic demonstration and does not perform actual phone service actions.
- It uses `goto` statements for menu navigation, which may not be considered good practice in larger or more complex programs.
- Feel free to modify and extend the program according to your needs.
